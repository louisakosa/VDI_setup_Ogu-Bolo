# VDI_setup_Ogu-Bolo
Re-initializing a VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructue) setup in Ogu-Bolo Local Government Area of Rivers State. 
 

The Project was reviving a VDI Lab Setup, the lab setup had been grounded for over a year, all vendor licences has expired and all configurations lost or wiped from the devices. The Labs were initially created and maintained by third party firms sponsored by the River State government. The idea was to use them as computer labs for IT/Computer Operation and Apriciation training for pupils in public primary schools. A shift in power (political) and effects of "COVID" contibuted to the decay of these infrstructures. I was invited to assist in resuscitating the infrastructure.
